## How to Play
1. **Start the server:** Run the 'server.py' script.
2. **Connect the clients:** Run the 'client.py' script on two or three different machines or terminals.
3. **Play the game:** Players will be shown a question about networking and whoever answers first will win the point! The first player to get 10 questions right wins!

## Technologies Used
* Python
* Sockets

## Statement of Work
### Project Title:

### Assumptions:
It is assumed that the CSU CS Lab computers will be available to run the Python scripts. It is also assumed that players have the resources to/understanding of how to run Python scripts.
### Roles and Responsibilities:
As a single person team, I will be all roles of project manager, developer, and tester:
* Project Manager Responsibilities:
* Developer Responsibilities:
* Tester Responsibilities: 
### Communication Plan:
As a single person team, a communication channel is not needed.

The frequency of project updates will be at least 3 times weekly.
### Additional Notes:
•	[Include any other relevant information or considerations that are specific to your project.]
